RATIONALE FOR GPL-3+

Maple Linux Core uses GPL-3 or later to:

1. Align with the free software philosophy that underlies Debian and GNU/Linux
2. Ensure that improvements and modifications remain available to the community
3. Prevent proprietary forks that would deny users the freedom to modify and share
4. Honor the spirit of the upstream projects we build upon
5. Protect the collaborative nature of this Canadian-focused distribution

The "or later" clause allows compatibility with future versions of the GPL,
ensuring long-term flexibility while maintaining copyleft protections.
